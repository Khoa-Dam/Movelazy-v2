# Movelazy
The Movement extension 


# Vision  
I believe the team is young and needs time to grow with the product. That's why I will help, mentor, and inspire them. This plan focuses on three main goals: 
* Improving our product for the Move ecosystem,
* Developing our brand profile
* building a community of developers (focus Movement protocols)
